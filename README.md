# DGSort
Sorting anything, but at the very start it was Danganronpa Sort.  
Built mostly for Windows x86.  
Based on [old th sort](http://mainyan.sakura.ne.jp/thsort.html).  

# Usage
Choose any pictures you like using instruction and you'll be able to sort them by comparing with your own taste.

# But how to build it
Cmake is presented. If there are problems you can just create this project yourself, but then you'll have to get:  
* FreeImage.dll; FreeImage.lib; FreeImage.h (those are already here)
* SDL2.dll, SDL2 libs and headers...
* SDL2_mixer.dll and lib
* nfd.lib/nfd_d.lib; nfd.h (those are already here)


Can be useful when you're bored of these tier lists. ~1000 lines of code
